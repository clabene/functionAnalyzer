Mathematical functions parser and analyzer.
Main features:
- Main mathematical operations: +, -, *, /, power, root, logarithm, factorial
- arbitrary number of variables
- Monte Carlo integration
- in-line notation (eg "2^3") and function notation (eg "pw(2,3)") both supported (atm only for power, root and logarithms)
- mathematical constants (atm Pi and Euler's number only)

TODO
- UI
- plotter (only 2D)
- improve testing
- include wider support for function notation
